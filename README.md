# <span style="color:blue">Shuvayan Brahmachary

I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Informatics, at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/), Germany, under the supervision of [Dr. Nils Thuerey](https://ge.in.tum.de/) (Jan. 2022- present). Previously, I have worked as a postdoc fellow in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at [Kyushu University](https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/), Japan, under the mentorship of [Dr. Hideaki Ogawa](http://aero.kyushu-u.ac.jp/stsel/about.html) (Sept. 2019 untill Sept. 2021). I have obtained my Ph.D from [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ac.in/) in the Department of Mechanical Engineering under the guidance of [Dr. Ganesh Natarajan](https://sites.google.com/site/ganucfd/) and [Prof. Niranjan Sahoo](https://iitg.irins.org/profile/128417). My Ph.D <a href="Thesis_short_version.pdf" target="_blank">thesis.</a> title is "Finite Volume/Immersed Boundary Solvers for Compressible Flows: Development and Applications". 

My research experience and interest include development of novel algorithms aimed at the accurate numerical simulation of fluid flows using non-conformal flow solvers, its seamless integration to aerodynamic design and optimisation. I have developed a keen interest in the *responsible* use of data-driven approaches for fluid mechanics related problems, *e.g.,* shape optimisation, fluid-flow reconstruction, flow control, etc. 

I am an avid Chelsea FC fan since 2002, occasional reader and mindfulness practitioner.
