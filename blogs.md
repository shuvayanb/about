* [**Invited Talk at Worcester Polytechnic Institute**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfOCHx_tRG8&ab_channel=Param-IntelligenceLab)

This was an invited talk at the Param intelligence seminar series organised by Prof. Jagtap @ the Worcester Polytechnic Institute. This talk discusses the use of a Large langaue model assisted Evolutionary Optimiser (LEO) for industrial applications. 

* [**Physics informed Kolmagrov Arnold Network PiKAN**](https://medium.com/@scimlteam/when-kolmogorov-arnold-network-meet-pinns-good-bad-and-the-ugly-0cd023e148e2)

This article explores the utility of PiKAN for PDE problems such as Burger's equation, 1D reaction hyperboic equation, Fischer Tropsch systhesis. 


* [**Differentiable Physics for Unsteady Fluid Dynamics**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/differentiable-physics-unsteady-fluid-dynamics-shuvayan-brahmachary-dcmnc/?trackingId=KH%2BVmNNcT06VNdRH9Qxf%2BQ%3D%3D)

This article presents the use cases of a differentiable flow solver for training a neural network for complex flow past arbitrarily shaped bodies.  


* [**Principal component analysis in aerodynamic shape optimisation**](https://backpackandbliss.wordpress.com/2021/05/16/principal-component-analysis-in-aerodynamic-shape-optimisation/)

This article highlights the utility of dimensionality reduction technique, i.e. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data compression and image (or flowfield) classification. 

* [**Just another PhD**](https://backpackandbliss.wordpress.com/2019/06/23/just-another-ph-d/)

Does a successful PhD warrant accomplishments of all research objectives? This blog shares my experience with the use of non-conformal solvers in hypersonic flows and the need to emphasise on negative results in a thesis.
