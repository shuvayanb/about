Ocassionally I take time to pen down my thoughts on various topics. Here's a list of few of them (please ignore the raw quality of these writings!)

* [**Just another PhD**](https://backpackandbliss.wordpress.com/2019/06/23/just-another-ph-d/)

Does a successful PhD warrant accomplishments of all research objectives? This blog shares my experience with the use of non-conformal solvers in hypersonic flows and the need to emphasise on negative results in a thesis.

* [**Principal component analysis in aerodynamic shape optimisation**](https://backpackandbliss.wordpress.com/2021/05/16/principal-component-analysis-in-aerodynamic-shape-optimisation/)

This article highlights the utility of dimensionality reduction technique, i.e. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data compression and image (or flowfield) classification.
