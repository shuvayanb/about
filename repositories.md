Here's a list of Github repos that might be useful

* [**Awesome scientific foundational models**]([https://github.com/tum-pbs/DiffPhys-CylinderWakeFlow](https://github.com/ParamIntelligence/Awesome-Scientific-Foundation-Models))
This repository tracks research on scientific foundation models â€” large, reusable models pre-trained on scientific data (text, code, signals, fields, etc.) that can be adapted to many downstream scientific tasks.

* [**Differentiable physics for unsteady cylinder wakes**](https://github.com/tum-pbs/DiffPhys-CylinderWakeFlow) This repository contains the code, scripts as well as datasets for the research undertaken by me at TUM on Differentiable physics-assisted neural networks (DPNN) for spatio-temporal predictions of unsteady wake flows past arbitrary bodies.

* [**Phiflow validation test cases**](https://github.com/shuvayanb/Phiflow_validation) This repository is meant for the validation test-cases performed using Phiflow for benchmark fluid flow problems

* [**LFF for aerodynamic design and shape optimisation**](https://github.com/shuvayanb/LFF-for-design-and-optimisation) This repository stores various low-fidelity framework for aerodynamic design and shape optimisation for canonical configurations
