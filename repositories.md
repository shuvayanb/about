Here's a list of Github repos that might be useful

* [**Differentiable physics for unsteady cylinder wakes**](https://github.com/tum-pbs/DiffPhys-CylinderWakeFlow)

This repository contains the code, scripts as well as datasets for the research undertaken by me at TUM on Differentiable physics-assisted neural networks (DPNN) for spatio-temporal predictions of unsteady wake flows past arbitrary bodies.

* [**Phiflow validation test cases**](https://github.com/shuvayanb/Phiflow_validation)

This repository is meant for the validation test-cases performed using Phiflow for benchmark fluid flow problems

* [**LFF for aerodynamic design and shape optimisation**](https://github.com/shuvayanb/LFF-for-design-and-optimisation)

This repository stores various low-fidelity framework for aerodynamic design and shape optimisation for canonical configurations
